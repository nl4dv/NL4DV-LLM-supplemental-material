## Initial-Prompts
This folder contains the initial set of prompts used for generating analytic specifications from natural language queries. It includes various example queries and their corresponding outputs. [Initial-Prompts Folder](./Initial-Prompts)

## Final-Prompt
This folder contains the refined and final version of the prompts that was developed after iterating on the initial prompts. [Final-Prompts Folder](./Final-Prompt)

**Note:**This prompt was created at the time of [NLVIZ](https://www.nl-vizworkshop.com/) submission and may have undergone revisions in recent versions of NL4DV.


## Preliminary-Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of our NL4DV-LLM prompt in generating analytic specifications and visualizations, we conducted a preliminary evaluation using the NLVCorpus dataset (https://nlvcorpus.github.io/). This folder contains:
- The nl4dv-llm-evaluation file which contains the preliminary evaluation of the prompt with the NLVCorpus dataset. This file contains the final results indicating whether the visualizations generated by NL4DV-LLM were accurate or not. [nl4dv-llm-evaluation](./Preliminary-Evaluation/nl4dv-llm-evaluation.xlsx)

## Example-Gallery
The example gallery folder contains the visualizations generated by NL4DV-LLM for various natural language queries selected from a subset of the NLVCorpus dataset.[Sample-queries+Vis](./Example-Gallery/sample-queries+vis.xlsx)
