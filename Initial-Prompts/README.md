# Generating Analytic Specifications for Data Visualization from Natural Language Queries using Large Language Models

## Initial-Prompts
- [1](1.png)st, and [2](2.png)nd prompt was our initial test of the capability of LLM with ChatGPT to see if it could generate Vega-Lite specifications given a subset of the dataset and a query.
- [Analytical Task Classification](analytical_task_classification.png) contains the prompt where we provided ChatGPT with a context of low-level analytic tasks using JSON objects describing analytic tasks, along with a subset of the dataset and a few natural language queries. 
- We also tested the capability of LLM using ChatGPT to extract metadata using our prompts and its ability to understand JSON objects describing analytic tasks, which is in [Dataset Feature Metadata](Dataset_Feature_Metadata.pdf).
- [Prompt Development (Different Versions)](Prompt_Development(Different_Versions).pdf) contains the different versions of the prompt iteratively developed.
- [Prompt with Response](Prompt_with_Response.pdf) contains the prompt with a subset of the dataset and a few natural language queries, with responses generated by ChatGPT detecting tasks, attributes detected, and the Vega-Lite specification for visualization.
